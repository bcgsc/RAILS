Quick test to assess installation

Execute "runme.sh" at the unix prompt
eg. ./runme.sh

It will run cobbler + RAILS, using simulated reads to first patch gaps in a SARS assembly draft sequence (cobbler) and scaffold+patch gaps (RAILS) using those same reads. 

./runRAILS.sh SARSassembly.fa SARSreads.fa 90 0.95
