abstract="While next-generation sequencing technologies have made sequencing genomes faster and more affordable, deciphering the complete genome sequence of an organism remains a significant bioinformatics challenge, especially for large genomes. Low sequence coverage, repetitive elements and short read length make de novo genome assembly difficult, often resulting in sequence and/or fragment ``gaps'' -- uncharacterized nucleotide (N) stretches of unknown or estimated lengths. Some of these gaps can be closed by re-processing latent information in the raw reads. Even though there are several tools for closing gaps, they do not easily scale up to processing billion base pair genomes.",

abstract="Advances in sequencing technology allow genomes to be sequenced at vastly decreased costs. However, the assembled data frequently are highly fragmented with many gaps. We present a practical approach that uses Illumina sequences to improve draft genome assemblies by aligning sequences against contig ends and performing local assemblies to produce gap-spanning contigs. The continuity of a draft genome can thus be substantially improved, often without the need to generate new data.",

abstract="De novo assembly is a commonly used application of next-generation sequencing experiments. The ultimate goal is to puzzle millions of reads into one complete genome, although draft assemblies usually result in a number of gapped scaffold sequences. In this paper we propose an automated strategy, called GapFiller, to reliably close gaps within scaffolds using paired reads. The method shows good results on both bacterial and eukaryotic datasets, allowing only few errors. As a consequence, the amount of additional wetlab work needed to close a genome is drastically reduced. The software is available at                   http://www.baseclear.com/bioinformatics-tools/                                  .",

abstract="Owing to the complexity of the assembly problem, we do not yet have complete genome sequences. The difficulty in assembling reads into finished genomes is exacerbated by sequence repeats and the inability of short reads to capture sufficient genomic information to resolve those problematic regions. In this regard, established and emerging long read technologies show great promise, but their current associated higher error rates typically require computational base correction and/or additional bioinformatics pre-processing before they can be of value.",

abstract ={Summary: Novel DNA sequencing technologies with the potential for up to three orders magnitude more sequence throughput than conventional Sanger sequencing are emerging. The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each. Due to ubiquitous repeats in large genomes and the inability of short sequences to uniquely and unambiguously characterize them, the short read length limits applicability for de novo sequencing. However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved. We describe SSAKE, a tool for aggressively assembling millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching through a prefix tree for the longest possible overlap between any two sequences. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from short sequence reads by stringently assembling them into contiguous sequences that can be used to characterize novel sequencing targets.Availability:http://www.bcgsc.ca/bioinfo/software/ssakeContact:rwarren@bcgsc.ca},
